# Kitty IPY Mime

This is a simple IPython extension that add the `image/png` mime type to IPython so it can display images in the terminal :)


## Installation

To install simply run:

```
pip install git+
```

## Configuration

There is not much configuration, but you can use `kitty_ipy_mime.set_latex_color(new_color)` to set the latex color to any hex color in the format '#CCCCCCCC'.
For convenience you can probably put this in your configuration?
